# harness_enchanting

happy ghast harnesses now accept these vanilla enchantments via an anvil:
- **depth strider** (flying speed)
- **soul speed** (more flying speed, in the nether)

the flying speed depends on the levels of applied enchantments:
- **depth strider I-III**: +0.25, +0.50, +0.75
- **soul speed I-III**: +0.10, +0.17, +0.25

sadly, afaik you can't make harnesses enchantable on the enchanting table, which is a shame, because people who don't know this data pack is installed would never know to put the harness in an anvil and specifically any of the above enchantments.

in a modded environment, this data pack might also cause problems. not sure which mod caused this, but i was able to essentially duplicate enchanted books, because the second input slot didn't empty itself after merging depth strider and soul speed. sorry about that!

**internally the data pack overwrites both vanilla enchantments in order to accept them when applied via an anvil.**

_see this as a proof of concept. might take a shot at making this a mod and expanding it with other vanilla enchantment effects like thorns = build off of the happy ghast when it is stationary (player stands on it)._
