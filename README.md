# harness_enchanting

happy ghast harnesses now accept these vanilla enchantments via an anvil:
- **depth strider** (flying speed)
- **soul speed** (more flying speed, in the nether)

the flying speed depends on the levels of applied enchantments:
- **depth strider I-III**: +0.25, +0.50, +0.75
- **soul speed I-III**: +0.10, +0.17, +0.25

# known issues
sadly, afaik you can't make harnesses enchantable on the enchanting table*, which is a shame, because people who don't know this data pack is installed would never know to put the harness in an anvil and specifically any of the above enchantments.

_* i found [this project](https://modrinth.com/datapack/harness-enchanting) (snatched the "harness-enchanting" url slug just to name it "Soar The Skies"_ 🥺🙈) _which might just enable enchanting table usage. will look into this._

in a modded environment, this data pack might also cause problems. not sure which mod caused this, but i was able to essentially duplicate enchanted books, because the second input slot didn't empty itself after merging depth strider and soul speed. sorry about that!

**internally the data pack overwrites both vanilla enchantments in order to accept them when applied via an anvil.**

# project status
_see this as a proof of concept._ i (or you, please go for it!) might take a shot at making this a mod and expanding it with other vanilla enchantment effects like thorns = build off of the happy ghast when it is stationary (player stands on it). tried this in the data pack using barrier blocks but the ghast suffocated and barrier block placement wasn't as straightforward. i'm sure there's a way to do this, though!
